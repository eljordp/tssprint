      { question: 'How do I place an order?', answer: 'Browse our products, customize your options (size, material, quantity), and add to cart. At checkout, fill out your info and pay via PayPal. You\'ll receive an order confirmation immediately.' },
      { question: 'Is there a minimum order quantity?', answer: 'For custom stickers, our minimum is 50 pieces. For business print (cards, flyers), minimums vary by product. Large format items like vehicle wraps and signage are per-project pricing with no minimum.' },
      { question: 'Do you offer bulk discounts?', answer: 'Yes! Our pricing is tiered — the more you order, the lower the per-unit price. You\'ll see the price breaks automatically when selecting quantities. For orders over 1,000 units, contact us for custom quotes.' },
      { question: 'What payment methods do you accept?', answer: 'We accept all major credit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay through our secure PayPal checkout. For large orders ($500+), we can arrange invoicing or payment plans.' },
      { question: 'Do you have promo codes or discounts?', answer: 'Yes! We offer promo codes for friends & family, first-time customers, and special events/trade shows. Enter your code at checkout to see your discount applied instantly.' },

    title: 'Design & Artwork',
    faqs: [
      { question: 'Do I need to have a design ready?', answer: 'Not necessarily! We accept print-ready files (PNG, JPG, PDF, AI, SVG, EPS), but we also offer design assistance. Upload what you have and we\'ll work with you to get it print-ready.' },
      { question: 'What file formats do you accept?', answer: 'We accept PNG, JPG, PDF, AI, SVG, and EPS files. For best results, provide vector files (AI, SVG, EPS) or high-resolution images (300 DPI minimum). We\'ll let you know if your file needs adjustments.' },
      { question: 'What is your proof process?', answer: 'Every order includes a free digital proof within 24 hours. You\'ll see exactly how your stickers, signs, or prints will look before we produce them. We won\'t print until you approve.' },
      { question: 'Can you match specific brand colors?', answer: 'Yes! We can match Pantone colors and work from your brand guidelines. Just include your color codes or brand kit when you place your order.' },

    faqs: [
      { question: 'What sticker materials do you offer?', answer: 'We offer matte vinyl, glossy vinyl, clear/transparent, holographic, paper, and specialty finishes like embossed and UV spot coating. All vinyl stickers are waterproof, UV-resistant, and built to last outdoors.' },
      { question: 'How durable are your stickers?', answer: 'Our vinyl stickers are waterproof, UV-resistant, and rated for 3-5 years of outdoor use. They\'re perfect for laptops, water bottles, cars, signage, and packaging. Paper stickers are best for indoor use.' },
      { question: 'What vehicle wrap materials do you use?', answer: 'We use premium 3M and Avery cast vinyl for vehicle wraps — the industry standard for durability, conformability, and color accuracy. Full wraps include a protective laminate for scratch and UV resistance.' },

      { question: 'Do you ship nationwide?', answer: 'Yes! We ship anywhere in the continental United States. Standard shipping is free on all orders. Expedited and overnight shipping options are available at checkout.' },
      { question: 'What about large format items (signs, wraps)?', answer: 'Vehicle wraps and large signage are typically installed by our team in the Bay Area. For out-of-area customers, we can ship flat or rolled items. Installation-required items (wraps, window film) need an on-site appointment.' },
      { question: 'Can I pick up my order locally?', answer: 'Yes! Bay Area customers can pick up orders from our location. Just select "Local Pickup" or contact us to arrange a pickup time. This is the fastest way to get your order.' },
